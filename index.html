      <h3>The Dice game involves luck and decision-making. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.</h3><br>
      <p>Here are the rules of the Dice game:<br/>
        &nbsp;Gameplay:
        <ol>
          <li>
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      On your turn, you roll a standard six-sided dice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Each number on the dice corresponds to a specific action:
                  </li>
                  <li>If you roll a 1, you score no points for the turn, and your turn ends. It&apos;s the next player&apos;s turn.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      If you roll a 2 to 6, you add that number of points to your turn score and choose whether to roll again (risking your accumulated turn score) or hold.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      If you decide to roll again: Repeat the above steps, accumulating points for each roll of 2 to 6.
                      If you roll a 1, your turn score is reset to zero, and your turn ends. It&apos;s the next player&apos;s turn.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      If you decide to hold: You add your turn score to your total score, and your turn ends.It&apos;s the next player&apos;s turn.
                  </li>
              </ol><br>
              Scoring:
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      Players accumulate points during their turn by rolling 2 to 6 on the dice. These points are added to their turn score.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      If a player rolls a 1, they score no points for that turn, and their turn score is reset to zero.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The turn score is only added to the total score when the player decides to hold.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The first player to reach or exceed the target score (100) wins the game.
                  </li>
              </ol><br>
